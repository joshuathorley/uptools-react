### Simple React Boilerplate

This is a modified version of the React Boilerplate by Max Stoiber which suits my tastes in folder structure. Not claiming as my own work at all, this is just used for me to quickly build concept apps without too much setup to get it how I like it. Simple. Feel free to check it out though, I'll probably improve it and keep it up to date with React Boilerplate and new structures I learn to love.
